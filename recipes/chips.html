 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>While undoubtedly you can make great restaurant-style French fries by cooking frozen chips in an air fryer, you can also produce delicious chunky, chip-shop-style chips made entirely from scratch. Any potato will work but waxy varieties are best for this recipe, and if you have any leftover potatoes where the skins are starting to go soft these will taste almost exactly like they came from the local chippy.</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
  <li>2 large potatoes (approximately 450g/1lb), preferably a waxy variety</li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
  <li>salt, to taste</li></ul></p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Leaving the skins on, cut the potatoes into roughly 1cm/½in thick chips. Toss with the oil and a generous amount of salt.</li>
      <li>Air-fry for 20–30 minutes at 180C, tossing every 10 minutes or so until the chips are crisp and golden, making sure they don’t stick to the bottom of the basket towards the beginning of cooking.</li>
    </ol>
